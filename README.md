My current progress: 
![6%](https://progress-bar.dev/6)

Course source: [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com)

Projects might be changed in my own implementation as it would be more interesting to me.

1. [JavaScript drum kit](https://meme-drum-machine.netlify.app) - changed to JS Meme Drum kit, it is more funny :)
